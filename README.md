# Exchange Rates Website ðŸ’°ðŸ’¹

This project is a dynamic web application that displays real-time exchange rates for various currencies. It features a React frontend created with Vite and an ASP.NET 8 C# backend. Users can select a base currency from a dropdown menu and view exchange rates for other currencies in a visually appealing table. The exchange rates are fetched in real time from a backend API, ensuring up-to-date information by leveraging a free external API service. This project demonstrates seamless integration and efficient data handling for financial applications.
